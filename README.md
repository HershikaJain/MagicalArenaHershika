Welcome to the Magical Arena, where players engage in epic battles using their unique abilities and strategic prowess!

Overview
The Magical Arena is a Java-based simulation where players with distinct attributes—health, strength, and attack—face off against each other. The objective is simple yet thrilling: defeat your opponent by reducing their health to zero.

Features
Player Attributes: Each player is defined by their health, strength, and attack attributes, which influence their combat capabilities.
Turn-Based Combat: Players take turns attacking, utilizing dice rolls to determine damage dealt and defended.
Dynamic Gameplay: The outcome of each battle depends on strategic decisions, dice rolls, and the unique attributes of each player.

Game Mechanics:
